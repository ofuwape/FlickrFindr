# Project Overview:
Create an Android app that displays photos returned from the Flickr search API. This should be
written in Android/Java. The project should compile in the latest stable version of Android
Studio.

# Technologies:
- Android SDK
- REST API
- JSON parsing

# Functional Requirements:
- Provide an interface for inputting search terms
- Display 25 results for the given search term, including a thumbnail of the image and the title
- Selecting a thumbnail or title displays the full photo
- Provide a way to return to the search results
- Provide a way to search for another term
- Save prior search terms and present them as quick search options
- Page results (allowing more than the initial 25 to be displayed)
- Sensible error handling and testing

# Technical Requirements:
- Make all calls to the Flickr REST API
- Consume all API content in JSON
- Use your own code to communicate with the Flickr API (Use of other third-party libraries is
okay)
- At least 1 file (and at most 2) must be written in Kotlin
